    description2: "During the day I work on freelance projects for a local business or find projects to contribute my skills to make a better world. When I worked as a business administrator many years ago in a software company, I was always curious about how my coworker developers made solutions. I thought they were all artists because they made masterpieces from ideas. I wanted to become one of them and that is how I got into this field. It is the time. I will be one of your team members who realize the business idea into a real service.",
